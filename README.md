* Transformers_development.ipynb - file where we preprocess the data and get the final results for transformer benchmarking
* final_... - various file that pooled the results from running multiple tests 
* src/benchmark_1 - main code we develop to implement our routing algorithm
* src - files that constitue the simulator, we helped develop various functions in this file
